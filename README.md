Shopwise's prime function is the generation of a Shopping List ordered by Shop then Aisle and finally Product.
The Shopping List incldes the Total Cost, the amount remaining to be spent and the amount spent.
Products, when the specified quantity has been bought, are crossed off.
Item's that have not been purchased are carried over.

Items can be set to appear on a checklist, which acts as a reminder.

Items can be added automatically to the Shopping List at regular intervals via the Rules feature.
As an alternative to automatic addition, indicidual Rules can be set to prompt.
Intervals are defined by selecting a period (Days, Weeks, Fortnights, Months, Quarters or Years) and
specifying a multiplier e.g. Weeks3 would add or prompt every 3 weeks.
